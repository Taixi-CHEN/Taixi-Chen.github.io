I am Taixi Chen, a year 4 undergraduate student at Hong Kong Baptist University. I gain a 4.0/4.0 GPA in my major concentration(Computer Science Technology) courses. Further, I get 4.0/4.0 in the second semester of year 3. I am very grateful for the guidance of my supervisor <a href="https://www.comp.hkbu.edu.hk/~ymc/"> Chair Prof. Cheung Yiu-ming</a>. My final year research paper explores a robust and fast rPPG algorithm for heart rate estimation. **My current research interests are machine learning, computer vision, and multimodal LLM for medical problems.** Anyone interested in me, please feel free to contact me!
